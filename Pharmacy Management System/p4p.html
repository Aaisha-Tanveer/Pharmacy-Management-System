<h3 style="font-size:22px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #045275; font-family:cursive;">Why you need pharmacy management software</h3><br>
<p>
A pharmacy management software is any system used in a pharmacy that helps automate the pharmacy workflow. This includes such tasks as reviewing physician orders and preparing medications, controlling the inventory and making drug orders, handling billing and insurance, providing counseling, identifying incompatibilities, and more -- all while following legal protocols and compliances.

And these are just the traditional functions that can be automated. Many more features can give the pharmacy a competitive edge by providing better customer experience and attract patients with more personalized and engaging service. We will talk in detail about such features in the following section. Now, let’s go through the main benefits a pharmacy management system will help you get.

Improving pharmacists efficiency. Pharmacists spend most of their working hours dispensing drugs. This task requires lots of concentration, a great deal of verification, drug interaction checking, not to mention making sense of the doctor’s handwriting. Is it necessary to dispense drugs manually? Not at all. With seamless computer-computer communication in place, prescriptions can be easily handled by software, freeing more time for pharmacists to interact with patients. Which leads us to the next benefit.
Improving patient health outcomes. Patients are seeking counseling from pharmacists and a PMS can directly or indirectly help them get better counseling. Apart from spending more time with a customer in person, pharmacists can communicate with them online on a patient portal. And by setting up a connection to a hospital’s EHR, a pharmacist can access a patient’s medication history to make better recommendations. Besides, special medicine adherence tools can help patients manage drugs they take, helping them easily refill prescriptions that are refillable and receive notifications about them.

Preventing medicine fraud. Pharmacies play a pivotal role in helping manage the distribution of controlled dangerous substances (CDSs) by entering all prescription information in the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program database and checking it when dispensing drugs. A pharmacy management system integrated with the PDMP portal allows you to cut down logging time and effort to just a few clicks as information is automatically added to the patient’s history.

<h3 style="font-size:22px; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 0px; color: #045275; font-family:cursive;">Pharmacy management system features</h3><br>
<p>
There are different types of computer systems used by pharmacists.

Web-based ordering systems. Often provided by drug wholesalers, these systems allow pharmacists to order medications on a wholesaler’s website.

Perpetual inventory systems. The use of perpetual systems (digital or not) is required by federal law for Schedule II controlled substances, and involves recording the quantity of medications continuously as the prescription is filled and dispensed. This way, the medication is automatically removed from inventory and you always have updated stock information.

Automatic dispensing systems. These are machines that automatically count and dispense pills for a pharmacist. Some complex systems even print the label apply it to the bottle.

A PMS usually performs the functions of a perpetual inventory system and provides additional features and integrations to manage all other processes. Let’s review them.

 <img style="align:center;" src="C:\Users\ameer\Desktop\images\invent.jpg"><br>
<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">Inventory management</h3>
<p>Inventory management processes in the pharmacy are saddled with paperwork and manual checks. Order forms are filled out manually and sent to manufacturers via fax, barcodes are scanned daily to update stock information, unclaimed prescriptions must be put back in stock, and so forth. Of course, not all of these processes can be automated due to federal laws and the technical limitations of your suppliers, but a PMS is able to handle some routine tasks.

Stock organization and counting. Medication counts are done regularly, but even that can’t help in the situation where drug amounts are counted incorrectly or not updated in the system on time. A PMS can keep a detailed log of your inventory that can be easily filtered by the required storage conditions and expiration date, allowing you to prevent dangerous errors.

Medication ordering. A PMS uses reorder points or par levels set up by the pharmacy to generate automatic orders. The system calculates how many items are needed to raise the stock level and adds this quantity to the order. The orders are then sent via an electronic data interchange (EDI) method.

Reporting. A PMS generates reports allowing pharmacists to easily determine the better performing wholesalers and vendors and understand what factors come into play when ordering medications. This can help them better prepare for the flu season when certain drugs are in demand, and automatically calculate par levels.<br>

<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">E-prescribing</h3>
<p>The process of e-prescribing involves the electronic creation and transmission of a prescription between a prescriber and a pharmacy. Using an EHR or more particularly a computerized provider order entry (CPOE) system, a doctor creates a medication order and sends it to a patient’s pharmacy via secure connection. The pharmacy can then communicate that the order was received and filled, and even notify if the patient hasn’t picked up their medication. Renewal requests can also be made in a couple of clicks.

This eliminates paperwork and helps ensure that the order is never lost or misunderstood -- the dosage is always accurate since the possibility of human error is minimized.

The system-to-system communication is enabled by a special XML-based standard called SCRIPT. All prescription software should be certified by Surescripts (which functions like EHR certification), so check their database to see whether your PMS vendor supports it or get your system certified.<br>

<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">Compounding</h3>
<p>Compounding features are tightly intertwined with inventory management and prescribing, so they’re often presented as one solution. There are several ways in which a PMS can ensure accuracy in the process of drug dosing.

Scale integration. A PMS will be able to connect to scales and automatically log weight, even sending alerts when the weight is out of tolerance range.

Batch support and multi-batch compounding. Software can easily create compound batches, manage their quantities, and organize them. You can also combine batches into one prescription with all information detailed to easily track them down.

Automatic compound pricing and billing. The system will calculate prices for your compound items based on average wholesale prices of the ingredients.

Let’s cover more features that help improve customer experience.<br>

<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">Medication therapy management</h3>
<p>In a previous article, we talked about the importance of patient engagement, particularly in a hospital setting and during patient-doctor interaction. The pharmacy environment presents even more capabilities to influence patients’ adherence habits and consequently improve customer relationships. This set of services provided by pharmacists is known as Medication Therapy Management.<br>

MTM includes such processes as:<br>

Creating a medication treatment plan
Resolving drug-related problems
Providing patient education and training
Here are some features of PMSs that support MTM activities.

Collecting patient information. A PMS works similar to the way a CRM does, gathering information about the patient from different sources, including the current medication list, medical history, and test results from their hospital’s EHR, and data provided in conversation with the patient, such as lifestyle habits, socioeconomic factors, and health goals.

Patient information analytics. The collected data is then put to use by being translated into analytics. Such software called clinical decision support (CDS) systems can highlight problems depending on a patient’s goals and propose the most effective and safest medications.

Developing a patient care plan. Here, medication adherence tools in the form of notifications and calendars can be used. A physician and a pharmacist collaborate on the medication therapy plan and then follow the results.

Implementing and evaluating medication therapy. Once again, pharmacists and physicians assess any medication problems and side effects that arise during therapy and modify care strategies.

For these strategies to work, a pharmacist should have a strong collaboration with a physician and a reliable communication channel with a patient.<br>

<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">Point of sale and billing solution</h3>
<p>A modern point of sale system goes beyond processing credit card payments, supporting a shopping experience patients are used to and helping to manage the inventory.<br>
<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">McKesson</h3>
<p>McKesson is a provider of software for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesalers, and distributors, so they have a whole family of products to not only support your pharmacy operations, but also build a profitable business.

Its main solution is called EnterpriseRx. Implemented in the cloud, it offers tools for

automated prescription refills,
drug delivery,
medication adherence,
seamless communication with patients and physicians, and
reporting.
The base software can be augmented using tools from McKesson Pharmacy Business services, which offer Interactive Voice Response solutions, preconfigured health plans, video counseling, and more.

To get more from McKesson’s wide suite of products and industry network, you can design a custom solution with them and collaborate with equipment manufacturers. McKesson partners with vendors of many pharmacy-related software and provides EDI and API interfaces to connect with them.<br>

<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">Cerner Retail Pharmacy</h3>
<p>One of the EHR provider leaders, Cerner’s pharmacy solution leans hard into connectivity and ensures the data flow across processes. Namely, it supports SMART on FHIR data elements that simplify interoperability in healthcare.

This solution is a suite of features including

the hosting service for multi-location businesses,
a workflow automation tool,
a point of sale product, and
a medical adherence service.
They also have a wide selection of interfaces for third-party integration.<br>

<h3 style="align:left; color: #045275;">PioneerRx</h3>
<p>Unlike Cerner and McKesson, PioneerRx is focused on developing pharmacy software. It provides a fully integrated feature set with top-tier customer support.
